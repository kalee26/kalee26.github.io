### What is a partition?
In its simplest terms, a partition is an ordered collection of positive integers, and each of those integers is called a part.  We order the parts from largest to smallest.  Mathematically, we define them like this: A partition is a multiset $$\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_r)$$, where $$\lambda_i \geq \lambda_{i+1}$$, for $$i \in \left\[1,r-1\right\]$$.

A useful way of thinking about partitions is as rows of boxes, starting with the first part.  This is called a Young Diagram.  Drawing  partitions as Young Diagrams opens up all sorts of mathematical questions.  You can have a go at building your own partitions below.  Enter positive integers in descending order, separated by a comma, then press 'Draw' to see your partition.
